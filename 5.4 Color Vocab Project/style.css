  The main difference between the commented-out CSS and the active CSS lies in the properties applied to the elements.

  Background vs Color:
  
  In the commented-out section, the styles for #red, #blue, #orange, #green, and #yellow are setting the background-color, which changes the background color of these elements.
  In the active section, the styles for these elements are applying the color property, which changes the text color of the elements, not the background.
  Image Styling:
  
  In the commented-out CSS, the img tag's height and width are defined without the unit px. This is not standard and can cause unexpected behavior.
  In the active CSS, the height and width for img are defined using 200px, which is correct and ensures the image is 200 pixels by 200 pixels.
  Class .color-title:
  
  Both sections set the font-weight to normal, so this part behaves the same in both.   */
