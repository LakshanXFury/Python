"""
Advanced Decorators

Create a logging_decorator() which is going to print the name of the function that was called, the arguments it was
given and finally the returned output:

You called a_function(1,2,3)
It returned: 6
The value 6 is the return value of the function.
Don't change the body of a_function.
IMPORTANT: You only need to use *args, you can ignore **kwargs in this exercise. """
