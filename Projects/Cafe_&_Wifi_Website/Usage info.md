What This Does in CSS
flex: 1 on the paragraph lets the name adjust to fit cleanly next to the image.
min-width and max-width keep the name block from getting too small or too wide.
object-fit: cover ensures all images look uniform, no matter the source.
gap, box-shadow, and border-radius make the layout cleaner and modern.
