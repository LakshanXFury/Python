Hi Ethan Parker,

I hope you're doing well! It's been a while since we last caught up, and I thought it would be great to get together sometime soon.

How about we meet up for lunch. If that doesn't work for you, just let me know when you're free, and we can figure something out.

Looking forward to catching up and hearing what's new with you!

Best,
Lakshan S
